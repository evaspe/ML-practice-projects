Machine Learning practice projects in Python

Right now I am practicing writing code for machine learning. I am currently using numerical data on classic datasets. I have tried using more "fun" datasets (superheros, cereal, etc), and ended up learning what characteristics data needs to have for a predictive machine learning algorithm to make sense. Many of these datasets had too much missing information, useless features, or less than ideal potential target variables.

I have moved on to a classic ML dataset: the Wine Classification dataset. I just turned 21 so its time to learn about what makes a good wine. 

Later, I hope to then do some natural language processing and then image recignition. My interest really lies in images, but right now I need to practice.
